1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a library for building user interfaces that focuses on creating reusable components. It enables importing components and altering them with updated states to fit the developer's unique needs.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

Thinking in react is the process of building react components in such a way that breaks down the component hierarchy, builds a static version, finds where state should exist, and implements the component. 

3. Describe state.

State represents a value that changes when the component updates.

4. Describe props.

Props is the complete data that is given to a component to be implemented inside the component.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Syncing side effects in a React component comes down to running code within the Effect Hook. A developer may decide whether to update the component with initialization, or with every time the component receives new information.
